URI	Uniform Resource Identifier, a fuzzy umbrella term used to refer to both Uniform Resource Names and Uniform Resource Locators. &nbsp;Kind of like how "mammal" encompasses both "human" and "whale".
URN	Uniform Resource Name. &nbsp;It allows you to uniquely identify a resource. &nbsp;It's like your social security number. &nbsp;Or a book's ISBN. &nbsp;Note that these numbers don't tell you where to find these resources.
URL	Uniform Resource Locator. &nbsp;This tells you where to find a resource but doesn't guarantee that what's there will be what you're looking for. &nbsp;It's like your home address; you may have moved, so someone given your address may not find you there when they go looking.
the skillset necessary for web development with Rails	Ruby on Rails, HTML &amp; CSS, databases, version control, testing, and deployment.
web development	The term used to refer to creating software for the Internet. &nbsp;There's a big focus on what's happening behind the scenes of a website's face. &nbsp;The focus is on sites that have dynamic content (stuff that changes depending on what the user does), not static content (pages that remain the same).

web design	The term used to refer to the process of creating the customer-facing part of a website. &nbsp;For example, where should the text be? &nbsp;What colors should you use? &nbsp;Where should the links be? &nbsp;Basically, how should everything look and function?

What's the purpose of creating the first_app?	To introduce most of the programs that will be getting used:<div>&nbsp;- IDEs, text editors, &amp; command lines</div><div>&nbsp;- Ruby &amp; RubyGems</div><div>&nbsp;- version control with Git &amp; GitHub</div><div>&nbsp;- deploying with Heroku</div>
What's the purpose of the demo_app?	To give a quick bird's eye perspective of the dynamic features of a Rails application before you dive into the details of building each of those features.
What's the purpose of the sample_app?	This is the main course of the tutorial, that takes up most of the book; this is where you learn how to use Rails to build the fundamental features of web apps. &nbsp;The goal is to free you from being constrained to using scaffolding to build things.
