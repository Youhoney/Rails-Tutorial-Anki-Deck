Rails-Tutorial-Anki-Deck
========================

Flash cards to help people learn Ruby on Rails.

## Instructions for using the flashcards

### Installing Anki & importing the flashcards
1. Download Anki (flash card software): http://ankisrs.net/#download
2. Download the Rails-Tutorial-Anki-Deck.apkg file in this repository.
3. Run Anki.
4. Within Anki, select File-->Import
5. Navigate to and select the Rails-Tutorial-Anki-Deck.apkg

### To get a quick idea of what the cards contain
Check out Rails-Tutorial-Anki-Deck-Quick-Look.txt. That text document is _not_ a
replacement for the actual Anki package; it doesn't contain images, or
an indication of which cards should be double-sided.

### About Anki
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki
Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program.
Anki (暗記) is the Japanese word for "memorizing".


## Instructions for people who want to contribute:

### What sections of the Tutorial still need to be flashcarded
4/12 - I think I got up to section 1.3.something, maybe 1.3.2?  So everything up until
then should be more-or-less done.  I haven't done anything after that, so the majority
of the guide has still not been converted.

If you make changes to the deck and want to submit them to this repository, you'll
need to export the deck first.

### To export the deck to your hard drive:
1. From the Deck Browser open the deck you want to share.
2. Go to file-->export 
3. Under "Export Format," select "Packaged Anki Deck (*zip)"
4. Put in any tags you want to limit it to
