The Ruby on Rails Tutorial Anki Deck
========================

## What is this?

This is a project to make Anki flash cards to help people learn Ruby on Rails.
Specifically, these flash cards are designed to teach people all of the information that
Michael Hartl mentions in his book, the _The Ruby on Rails Tutorial_ (or just _Rails Tutorial_ for short).

### What's Anki?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki

Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program.
Anki (暗記) is the Japanese word for "memorizing".

### What's Ruby on Rails?

### What's Hartl's Rails Tutorial?

## Instructions for using the flashcards

### Installing Anki & importing the flashcards
1. Download Anki (flash card software): http://ankisrs.net/#download
2. Download the Rails-Tutorial-Anki-Deck.apkg file in this repository.
3. Run Anki.
4. Within Anki, select File-->Import
5. Navigate to and select the Rails-Tutorial-Anki-Deck.apkg

### To get a quick idea of what the cards contain
Check out Rails-Tutorial-Anki-Deck-Quick-Look.txt. That text document is _not_ a
replacement for the actual Anki package; it doesn't contain images, or
an indication of which cards should be double-sided.



## Instructions for people who want to contribute:

#### Chapter 1
I got up to section 1.3.something, maybe 1.3.2?  So everything up until
then should be more-or-less done.
