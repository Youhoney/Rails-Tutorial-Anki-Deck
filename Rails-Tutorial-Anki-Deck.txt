URI	Uniform Resource Identifier, a fuzzy umbrella term used to refer to both Uniform Resource Names and Uniform Resource Locators. &nbsp;Kind of like how "mammal" encompasses both "human" and "whale".		
URN	Uniform Resource Name. &nbsp;It allows you to uniquely identify a resource. &nbsp;It's like your social security number. &nbsp;Or a book's ISBN. &nbsp;Note that these numbers don't tell you where to find these resources.		
URL	Uniform Resource Locator. &nbsp;This tells you where to find a resource but doesn't guarantee that what's there will be what you're looking for. &nbsp;It's like your home address; you may have moved, so someone given your address may not find you there when they go looking.		
the skillset necessary for web development with Rails	Ruby on Rails, HTML &amp; CSS, databases, version control, testing, and deployment.		
web development	The term used to refer to creating software for the Internet. &nbsp;There's a big focus on what's happening behind the scenes of a website's face. &nbsp;The focus is on sites that have dynamic content (stuff that changes depending on what the user does), not static content (pages that remain the same).	y	
web design	The term used to refer to the process of creating the customer-facing part of a website. &nbsp;For example, where should the text be? &nbsp;What colors should you use? &nbsp;Where should the links be? &nbsp;Basically, how should everything look and function?	y	
What's the purpose of creating the first_app?	To introduce most of the programs that will be getting used:<div>&nbsp;- IDEs, text editors, &amp; command lines</div><div>&nbsp;- Ruby &amp; RubyGems</div><div>&nbsp;- version control with Git &amp; GitHub</div><div>&nbsp;- deploying with Heroku</div>		
What's the purpose of the demo_app?	To give a quick bird's eye perspective of the dynamic features of a Rails application before you dive into the details of building each of those features.		
What's the purpose of the sample_app?	This is the main course of the tutorial, that takes up most of the book; this is where you learn how to use Rails to build the fundamental features of web apps. &nbsp;The goal is to free you from being constrained to using scaffolding to build things.

What is a web application's GUI?	The web page that people interact with.		
What series of steps happen when a browser interacts with a Rails application?	1. The browser sends a request<div>2. It's received by a web server...</div><div>3. ...and passed on to a Rails controller, which is in charge of what to do next.</div><div>4a. In some cases, the controller will immediately render a view.</div><div>4b. More commonly for dynamic sites, the controller interacts with a model.</div><div>5. The model may communicate with the database.</div><div>6. After invoking the model, the controller then renders the view and returns the complete web page to the browser as HTML.<div><br /></div><div><img src="Rails-Tutorial\Model-View-Controller.jpg" /></div></div>		
the model-view-controller architectural pattern	The idea that web applications should have a clear separation between 1) the code used to design the <u>look</u> of a page and 2) the code used to determine what <u>information</u> gets put on the page. &nbsp;The face and the brains should be separate.	y
